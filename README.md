# web-design-project-BUS-465
This code is the front and back end for a website built for my Web Development course in Fall 2020. 
My teammates (Yanal Butt and Jenny Ren) and I designed the website as a prototype for a local business. I was the primary programmer for the project. 
The front-end of the site consisted of HTML for structure, CSS for styling and Javascript for animations and windows.
The back-end consisted of a customer database written in SQL and server side processing in PHP.
The site was hosted locally on an SFU Beedie server, and was tested extensively before being presented for grading.
